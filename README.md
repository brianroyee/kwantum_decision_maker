### Project Description
Quantum Decision Maker is an absurd web application that harnesses the power of quantum mechanics to answer your most pressing (or utterly trivial) questions! 
Built with *Flask and Qiskit*, the app simulates a 2-qubit quantum circuit to generate answers that are as unpredictable as a quantum wavefunction. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People get stuck making decisions without real guidance, especially for small, everyday stuff like what to eat or whether to take a nap. 
Regular tools like flipping a coin or asking a friend don‚Äôt always cut it, and there‚Äôs nothing out there that uses actual quantum mechanics to help with these choices. It‚Äôs kind of a pain when you‚Äôre overthinking simple things and have no way to get a fresh, random perspective that feels legit.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Quantum Decision Maker swoops in to save the day with a glorious blend of quantum computing and whimsy! Our Flask-powered web app constructs a 2-qubit quantum circuit, applies Hadamard gates to create superposition, entangles qubits with a CNOT gate, and throws in a random RX rotation for extra quantum flair. 
The circuit is simulated using Qiskit's AerSimulator, collapsing into one of four possible outcomes, each mapped to a collection of delightfully vague answers like "Schr√∂dinger says both yes and no" or "The answer is lost in quantum noise." The app presents the quantum circuit diagram, explains key quantum concepts in plain English, and delivers your answer with a side of cosmic humor. Why settle for boring decisions when you can let the quantum universe decide?
